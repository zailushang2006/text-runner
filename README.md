TextRunner executes unstructured documentation,
similar to what a human reader would do if they were reading and following it.
It also ensures that links and images in your documentation point to existing targets.
An example is the documentation you are reading right now,
which is verified for correctness by TextRunner.

There are no limitations on the text that TextRunner executes.
It can read and understand (if you tell it how)
any form of plain text in any human language as well as
complex data in tables, bullet point lists, and embedded images.


#### Use cases

- __evergreen tutorials:__
  your documentation is always correct,
  whether you change it or the product it describes
- __[semantic versioning](http://semver.org):__
  know whether a product change affects documented behavior
- __[readme-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html):__
  documentation is your product prototype and drives its implementation
