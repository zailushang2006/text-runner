# running JavaScript code

To run JavaScript code:

<a textrun="run-markdown-in-textrun">
```html
<a textrun="run-javascript">
`​``
console.log('This is getting executed by TextRunner!')
`​``
</a>
```
</a>

## Asynchronous code

TextRunner waits for the code block to finish before continuing with the test.
To make it wait for asynchronous code,
add the placeholder `<CALLBACK>` where your code would call the callback when its done.
Example:

<a textrun="run-markdown-in-textrun">
```html
<a textrun="run-javascript">
`​``
const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFile('hello.txt', 'hello world', <CALLBACK>)
`​``
</a>
```
</a>

Alternatively you can also use the placeholder `// ...`
<a textrun="run-markdown-in-textrun">

```html
<a textrun="run-javascript">
`​``
const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFile('hello.txt', 'hello world', function(err) {
  // ...
})
`​``
</a>
```

</a>

## Substitutions

Each block of Javascript code runs in its own environment.
To make local variables sharable between different blocks of Javascript,
this step performs the the following replacements:

- `/\bthis\./` --> `global.`
- `/\bconst /` --> `global.`
- `/\bvar /` --> `global.`

So `const foo = 123` gets turned into `global.foo = 123`,
thereby making `foo` accessible in all code blocks.

You can create your own replacements by adding a `replacements` block
for this action
in `text-run.yml`:

```yml
actions:
  runJavascript:
    replace:
      'regex to find': 'text to replace it with'
```
