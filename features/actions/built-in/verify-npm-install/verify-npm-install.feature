Feature: verifying NPM installation instructions

  As the developer of an NPM module
  I want to be able to verify that installation instructions for my module are correct
  So that my readers can start using my tool right away.

  - surround the installation instructions via the "verifyNpmPackageName" action


  Background:
    Given my source code contains the file "package.json" with content:
      """
      {
        "name": "my_enormous_package"
      }
      """


  Scenario: correct package name with triple-fenced code block
    Given my source code contains the file "1.md" with content:
      """
      To install, run:

      <a textrun="verify-npm-install">
