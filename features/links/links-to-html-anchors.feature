Feature: links to HTML anchors

  As a documentation writer
  I want to know whether links to other parts of the documentation work
  So that I can reference releated sections.

  - links pointing to non-existing parts of the same page or other pages
    cause the test to fail


  Scenario: link to an existing anchor in the same file
    Given my source code contains the file "1.md" with content:
      """
      A [working link to an anchor](#hello)
      text
      <a name="hello">hi</a>
      """
    When running text-run
    Then it signals:
      | FILENAME | 1.md           |
      | LINE     | 1              |
      | MESSAGE  | link to #hello |
