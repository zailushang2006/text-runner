Feature: setting the root directory of the documentation base to test

    When running Text-Runner inside a bot
  I want to be able to run it against a documentation base different from the current working directory
  So that my bot can test more than one documentation base at a time.

  - the configuration option "rootDir" allows to provide a different absolute root directory

  Background:
    Given my source code contains the file "print-dir.md" with content:
      """
      <a textrun="run-javascript">
        ```
        console.log(process.cwd())
        ```
      </a>
      """

  Scenario: default behavior
    When running text-run
    Then it prints the current working directory as the root dir
